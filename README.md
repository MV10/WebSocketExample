### 2020-June Update:
The `KestrelWebSocketServer` and `WebSocketClient` projects have been updated to .NET Core 3.1.x. The older `WebSocketExample` and `WebSocketWithBroadcasts` projects were based on the deprecated `HttpListener` technique and will not be updated or maintained. They are still here only because the first two articles reference them.

The Kestrel article did not clarify how I ran the project and I think this caused problems for some people. I set up Visual Studio to run the project in console mode (not under IIS Express or IIS). I also disabled browser auto-launch, which I think will open localhost to the wrong port. In the code Kestrel is configured for localhost:8080. I simply forgot that these settings aren't saved as part of the project file.

I've just now re-tested both projects and they are working normally under Win10, as well as Raspbian Linux on a Raspberry Pi 4B. :grin:
